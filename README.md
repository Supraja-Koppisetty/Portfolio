## Local Development Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

### 1. Prerequisites

You will only need a modern web browser to view the static files.

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd portfolio-master
```

### 3.Running Locally

Since this is a static HTML/CSS/JS site, you can open the main index.html file directly in your browser, or use a simple live-server extension (like VS Code's Live Server) for development:

```bash
# Example if using a live server in your IDE
# Open index.html with Live Server
```
